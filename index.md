# Welcome to an FFF 3D printing guide!

## So what is FFF 3D printing?
You may hear FFF and FDM used interchangeably. This is because FFF and FDM 3D printing refer to the same method. FFF being fused filament fabrication and FDM being fused deposition modeling. This sort of additive manufacturing is kind of like trying to make a house by squeezing frosting out of a tube. However, instead of you moving the tube it's some motors, and instead of frosting it's plastic. Well, if you're really determined, [you could still use frosting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ui0dcF48U9k).

## Disclaimer
At points in this guide I may have my opinion leak through. While I'll try to be as matter-of-fact as possible, I can't guarantee anything.

## Why?
Very often I see new members of the community confused in either discord, reddit, or whatever. Additionally, it can be hard to skim videos or even be able to tell what information will be in one.

Also, I built a Voron Trident for my professor and he needs to know how to use it.

Also also, my dad loves to troubleshoot. He got me into this hobby, so I should give back to him if he needs to fix his machine while I'm away.  

This is dedicated to my dad.
