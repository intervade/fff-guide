# Welcome to an FFF 3D printing guide!

### Why?
Very often I see new members of the community confused in either discord, reddit, or whatever. Additionally, it can be hard to skim videos or even be able to tell what information will be in one.

Also, I built a Voron Trident for my professor and he needs to know how to use it.

Also also, my dad loves to troubleshoot. He got me into this hobby, so I should give back to him if he needs to fix his machine while I'm away.
This is dedicated to my dad.
